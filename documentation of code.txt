Database Connection and Table Creation

The script starts by importing the sqlite3 module and connecting to a database file named "ice_cream_parlor.db". It then creates several tables using SQL statements:

flavors: stores information about ice cream flavors (id, name, description, season)
ingredients: stores information about ingredients (id, name, quantity)
allergens: stores information about allergens (id, name)
flavor_ingredients: stores relationships between flavors and ingredients (flavor_id, ingredient_id)
customer_suggestions: stores customer suggestions for new flavors (id, customer_name, flavor_name, description)
customer_allergens: stores customer allergen information (customer_name, allergen_id)
carts: stores customer cart information (customer_name, flavor_id)


Functions to Interact with the Database

The script defines several functions to interact with the database:

add_flavor: adds a new flavor to the flavors table
add_ingredient: adds a new ingredient to the ingredients table
add_allergen: adds a new allergen to the allergens table
add_flavor_ingredient: adds a relationship between a flavor and an ingredient to the flavor_ingredients table
add_customer_suggestion: adds a customer suggestion to the customer_suggestions table
add_customer_allergen: adds a customer allergen to the customer_allergens table
add_to_cart: adds a flavor to a customer's cart in the carts table
search_flavors: searches for flavors by name
filter_flavors: filters flavors by season
get_cart: retrieves a customer's cart contents


Main Function

The main function is an interactive menu that allows the user to perform various actions:

Add a flavor
Add an ingredient
Add an allergen
Add a flavor ingredient
Add a customer suggestion
Add a customer allergen
Add to cart
Search flavors
Filter flavors
Get cart
Quit

This application allows users to:

Maintain a cart of their favorite products
Search for flavors by name
Filter flavors by season
Add allergens if they don't already exist

The user is prompted to enter their choice, and the corresponding function is called with the required input parameters. The script uses a while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to quit.

Overall, this script provides a basic system for an ice cream parlor cafe, allowing users to manage flavors, ingredients, allergens, customer suggestions, and cart contents.
